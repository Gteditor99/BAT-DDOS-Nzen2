A small DDos program that will (In theory) take down your old 2003 laptop.
It won't harm anyone, nor anything.
Idk how you would take down a server with this, maybe running multiple instances of it...

Antiviruses DO flag this as a virus/threat, but in reality it's because I have no license with this.
If you do not believe me, just don't run the program!
I mean, It's not like it does anything.

If you do want to run the program, (Maybe benchmark a bunch of chinese off-brand Rasberry-Pie network adapters,
Just disable your antivirus while you run it.




:DOCUMENTATION:
This program was written in batch, and recompiled with BtE.

The first chunk of the code is a segment of the BtE API.
Random UUids coupled with some strings.

Next chunk is the fake loading screen, which I just added to make
the whole thing look more organized.
It echos a started message, (To log.txt)
and then echos ping localhost, (To log.txt)
then there is a textbook set variable command, (Which then is echoed to log.txt)
and then a few danger messages,
The ddos actually happens.
It will repeat ping requests that will down the shields on your 2003 Arsenal Bird. ;)
BELKA DID EVERYTHING WRONG!!!
